### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Oleksiy

As a Full-Stack JavaScript Developer I had been working in American product company (multinational team, Agile/Scrum) as well as in outsourcing company.

My primary focus is on Software Development. At the same time, I do have knowledge of SQL, SPSS, some exposure to statistics, Python for data analysis, and Tableau. Combined with my academic background as a researcher, this could make me a good fit for data-related positions such as Data Analyst.
